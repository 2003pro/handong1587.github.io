In *True Detective*, Rust told Marty, "I don't sleep, I just dream". I think this also describe my experience of my recent days. Dreaming all night long, vivid and detailed dream visuals, restless and exhausted.

Spanish Surrealist painter Dal√≠ once helped Walt Disney Company make a short film *Destino* in 2003.
