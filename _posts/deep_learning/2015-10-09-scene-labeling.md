**Learning hierarchical features for scene labeling**

- intro: "Their approach comprised of densely computing multi-scale CNN features
for each pixel and aggregating them over image regions upon which they are classified.
However, their methodstill required the post-processing step of generating over-segmented regions, 
like superpixels, for obtaining the final segmentation result. 
Additionally, the CNNs used for multi-scale feature learning were 
not very deep with only three convolution layers."
