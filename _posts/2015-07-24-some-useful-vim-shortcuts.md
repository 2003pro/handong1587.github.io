[Shifting blocks visually](http://vim.wikia.com/wiki/Shifting_blocks_visually)

In normal mode: type **>>** to indent the current line, or **<<** to unindent.

In insert mode, **Ctrl-T** indents the current line, and **Ctrl-D** unindents.

For all commands, pressing **.** repeats the operation.

For example, typing **5>>..** shifts five lines to the right, and then repeats 
the operation twice so that the five lines are shifted three times.
