*Enya* : **LOVE** all of her songs. So sad she didn't make new albums for quite a long time.

*Nightwish*: I like their symphonic metal style (or "opera metal") and Tarja's dramatic, "operatic" lead vocals. Anette is great too. But I **DO NOT** like the way the band fire Tarja and Anette.

*Green Day*:
