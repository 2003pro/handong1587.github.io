================

*The Bourne I,II,III* : Jason Bourne is cool. Love it!

*The Bourne Legacy (2014)* : Compared to original *The Bourne* trilogy, maybe this one is .. boring?

(2014-10-18) *Cool Hand Luke*: "What we've got here, is a failure to communicate."

*The Sting*:

*Road To perdition*:

(2014-11-16) *Interstellar*:

*Cashback (2006)* : Heard that the same name short clip won some awards. But this one is boring.
The good news is: really many UNNECESSARY nudity scenes.

*Rashômon (1950)* : My cousin, who is twelve years younger than me, asked me to watch this movie with him. And I slept half of the time while watching.

(2015-03-21) *Whiplash*:

(2015-03-31) *Kingsman: The Secret Service (2014)*: Colin Firth is gentle and cool, that church fight scene is awesome and cool. And I like *Free bird* even more.

(2015-05-03) *Furious 7*:

(2015-06-08) *Mr. Brooks (2007)*:

(2015-06-20) *鍵泥棒のメソッド (2012)*: Well, I found *香川 照之* is a bit like *Kevin Spacey*. Both are my favorite actors.

*Birdman (2014)*: I didn't realize this movie was shot in ONE TAKE - at lease that was what it looked like. Indeed, this is incredible awesome! Filmmaking tour de force! The insight, the direction, and the cinematography, all superb. If you haven't seen it yet now it is a must!

(2015-07-22) *Under the Skin*:

(2015-09-06) *Los cronocrímenes(Timecrimes)*: The story line is just like *Triangle*, but I have to say it is not so good as *Triangle*. And I found that this type of movies has its inevitable limitation: it has to use some kind of "wrap-around bandage" to make the whole story self-justified. It is easy to feel bored if watch this kind of movies two or more.

(2015-09-18) *Spy (2015)*: Just a popcorn movie. What impress me most is that bunch of British dirty languages..

(2015-09-20) *Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation (2015)*: The most exciting movie scene - Tom Cruise's insane plane stunt - appeared very early in the beginning of movie. Then what? A guy sitting next to me was found sleep during the second half. You can't blame him, I am pretty sure he is not the only person who agree the point that the second half of the movie is somewhat less exciting.
