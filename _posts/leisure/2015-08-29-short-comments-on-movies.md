================

*The Bourne I,II,III* : Jason Bourne is cool. Love it!

*The Bourne Legacy (2014)* : Boring.

*Cashback (2006)* : Heard that the same name short clip won some awards. But this one is boring.
The good news is: really many UNNECESSARY nudity scenes.

*Rashômon (1950)* : My cousin, who is twelve years younger than me, asked me to watch this movie with him. And I slept half of the time while watching.

(2015-09-06) *Los cronocrímenes(Timecrimes)*: The story line is just like *Triangle*, but I have to say it is not so good as *Triangle*. And I found that this type of movies has its inevitable limitation: it has to use some kind of "wrap-around bandage" to make the whole story self-justified. It is easy to feel bored if watch this kind of movies two or more.
