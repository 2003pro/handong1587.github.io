1. Push local modification to server

```
git add deep learning/paper/reinforcement
git commit -m "xxxxxx"
git push -u origin master
```

2. Solution to ERROR: "fatal: The remote end hung up unexpectedly"

```
git config http.postBuffer 524288000
git config --global http.postBuffer 157286400
```

3. Undo last two commits which not pushed yet (NOTE: this will also delete relevant local files)

```
git reset --hard HEAD~2
```

4. Undo commit, also roll-back codes to previous commit

```
git reset --hard commit_id
```

5. Undo commit, but won't undo local codes modification

**Can re-commit local changes by "git commit":**

```
git reset commit_id
```

6. Only view how many non-pushed commits

```
git status
```

7. Only view comments/descriptions of non-pushed commits

```
git cherry -v
```

8. View detailed informations of non-pushed commits

```
git log master ^origin/master
```

9. Find id of last commit

```
git log
```

10. Clone a particular version of commit-id

After git clone the newest repo:

```
git checkout [commit-id]
```

11. Convert that repo to my forked repo (stay tuned..)

12. Clone a specific Git branch

```
git clone -b
```

Example:

``` 
git clone -b my-branch https://git@github.com/username/myproject.git
```

Clone a Fast R-CNN COCO branch:

``` 
git clone --recursive -b coco https://github.com/rbgirshick/fast-rcnn.git
```

13. Save git username/password on Git for Windows

Create .git-credentials to save git username/password:

```
https://username:password@github.com 
```

```
git config --global credential.helper store
```

Re-run git bash.

14. One way to address SSL certificate problem

SSL certificate problem:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/BVLC/caffe.git
Cloning into 'caffe'...
fatal: unable to access 'https://github.com/BVLC/caffe.git/': SSL certificate problem: certificate is not yet valid
```

The easiest way is to disable the SSL CERT verification (This will prevent CURL to verity the HTTPS certification):

```
git config --global http.sslVerify false
```

For one repository only:

```
git config http.sslVerify falseSoluton
```
